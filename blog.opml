Even my dotfiles are in iCloud now. Eeek. All those symlinks! This was triggered by Dropbox just not running for some reason on my Mac Mini. I've no idea how long it's been off, but it means sync trouble for sure. I'm routing around the whole problem. Let's see if I've simply shifted from one set of problems to another.

I just really wanted an M10 and needed to sell the Q to fund it. The Monochrom Q2 was fantastic also, but I ultimately couldn't handle only black and white. I prefer doing conversion of color using Silver Efex anyway. But, the 47 megapixel resolution was a revelation. I used to be one of those &quot;cropping is cheating&quot; snobs but I got over that. Every photograph is cropped. Some are done using the viewfinder and some are done during processing. Same result. Anyway, the 28mm lens is too wide for me, but the big sensor let me easily crop to, say, a 50mm fov without loss of image quality. That's sweet. And the built-in 35mm and 50mm framelines of the Q2 make it feel a bit like using a rangefinder.

					<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;https://tiddlywiki.com/#Release%205.2.0&quot;&gt;TiddlyWiki 5.2.0&lt;/a&gt; was released recently, and it includes a great new feature that lets me drag and drop an image into an open &quot;tiddler&quot; which is then embedded and linked automatically. This is a terrific improvement, but it still embeds the image within the wiki file, which I was hoping to avoid." created="Wed, 20 Oct 2021 09:27:07 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Enter the &lt;a href=&quot;https://saqimtiaz.github.io/tw5-file-uploads/&quot;&gt;File Uploads plugin&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/saqimtiaz&quot;&gt;Saq Imtiaz&lt;/a&gt; and with it a brand-new PUT option for WebDAV." created="Wed, 20 Oct 2021 09:27:33 GMT"/>
					<outline text="This is all pretty new to me, so I'm probably not qualified to write a full-on tutorial, but here's what I did..."/>
					<outline text="Upgraded my wiki to 5.2.0. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://tiddlywiki.com/upgrade.html&quot;&gt;https://tiddlywiki.com/upgrade.html&lt;/a&gt;)" created="Wed, 20 Oct 2021 09:32:41 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Installed the File Uploads plugin and the accompanying PUT plugin via simple drag and drop into my wiki file (TiddlyWiki is cool that way). "/>
					<outline text="Configured the plugin by telling it to use the &quot;PUT&quot; uploader and where I'd like uploads to go (relative to the wiki file itself). I chose &quot;files/2021&quot;." created="Wed, 20 Oct 2021 09:22:55 GMT"/>

					<outline text="I run my wiki via WebDAV using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.schimera.com/products/webdav-nav-server/&quot;&gt;WebDAVNav Server app for macOS&lt;/a&gt;. There are other options for other OSes, but I'm not familiar with those. The benefit for me is that I can open and save my wiki with any browser, no other extensions are required. I run the WebDAV server on my Mac Mini and visit it there via https://localhost:8080/index.html. " created="Wed, 20 Oct 2021 09:25:05 GMT"/>
					<outline text="This is where the magic happens. I open a tiddler, drag an image into it, and boom! the file is uploaded to the files/2021 folder and a wikitext link is inserted automatically. So cool."/>
					<outline text="This is all dandy when editing the wiki on my Mac Mini with the WebDAV server running, but what about from my MacBook Air? I could probably figure out the IP used by the Mini on the LAN and access it that way, but that only works in my house if I want to get into dynamic DNS and port forwarding. (I don't)."/>
					<outline text="Enter &lt;a href=&quot;https://tailscale.com/&quot;&gt;Tailscale&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;Zero config VPN. Installs on any device in minutes, manages firewall rules for you, and works from anywhere.&quot;" created="Wed, 20 Oct 2021 09:28:57 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I was up and running with Tailscale on all my Macs, my iPhone, and my iPad in less than an hour. Tailscale provides a private network I can access from all my devices. This means that I can reach and edit my wiki via https://100.74.14.72:8080/index.html from everywhere. (That IP is not publicly routable so it's safe to share it.)" created="Wed, 20 Oct 2021 09:25:10 GMT"/>
					<outline text="It works with the WebDAV PUT uploads, too. I can drag an image from the Photos app on my iPad into Safari and the file ends up where it belongs on my Mac Mini. Magic!"/>
					<outline text="I don't know yet what the gotchas of this approach might be, but so far it has solved all of my issues with managing a single-file wiki with images from all my devices."/>
					<outline text="My wiki is published via Github Pages, so in order to push updates, I do need to commit and push the repo. I have the repo directory synced using SyncThing so the changes are always available on both my Macs. While I can edit my local version of the wiki from iOS, I'm not yet able to publish it from there."/>
					<outline text="It may look like a lot of fuss and moving parts, but so far I haven't felt any pain from it. All of the individual parts (TiddlyWiki, WebDAV server, Tailscale, SyncThing...)  run without issues and there aren't too many dependencies between them."/>
					<outline text="I hope this has made enough sense to get you started. Feel free to ask me to clarify anything you find confusing or missing."/>
